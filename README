Boxland is an small object-oriented programming project originally written by
two French students.

It was not intented to be publicly released, so we paid no attention to
internationalization.  The program is therefore entirely in French, including
comments in C++ code.  However, all identifiers (variables, functions,
constants, etc.) are in plain English.

Even if you don't understand French, you should manage to play very easily.
Here is a translation of the main screen instructions:
    In the game, use the arrow keys or the numeric pad to move the character.
    Pause: space or P. -- Cancel the last move: backspace or U.
    Restart the level: R. -- Quit the menu or the level: escape or Q.

And here are translations of some text elements:
    French           English

    Le jeu est fini. The game is finished.

Beside, playing to our game and reading its documentation will help you
improve your French skills! Isn't that wonderful? ;)

For more informations, and if you understand our rather difficult language,
you can take a look to our report in the "report-fr" directory.

Thank you for your interrest in Boxland!  We hope you'll enjoy our small game.
